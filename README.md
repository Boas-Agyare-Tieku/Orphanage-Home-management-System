Orphanage Food Managerial System

System Overview:
This system helps orphanages manage their food inventory efficiently with three main user roles:
1. Admin: Manages the system and user accounts (separate admin login)
2. Kitchen Staff: Regular users who log food stock, usage, and waste (user signup/login)
3. Manager/Donor: Views reports and performance analytics (future feature)

Note: When users sign up through the user portal, they are Kitchen Staff members who will log daily food operations.
